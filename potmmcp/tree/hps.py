    Consists of:
    1. the environment state
    2. the joint history of each agent up to given state
    3. the policies of the other agents
    4. (Optional) the hidden/internal state of policies

    The hidden/internal state is not a defining part of the HistoryPolicyState,
    since the it can in general be obtained from the history contained in the
    HistoryPolicyState. Rather it is potentially stored for to save
    recomputing it, which can offer significan saving in some cases (e.g. when
    dealing with a policy that uses an RNN).
